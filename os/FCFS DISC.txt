//track where the data is to be read or write. So the disk scheduling algorithm 
//that gives minimum average seek time is better.

//Rotational Latency: Rotational Latency is the time taken by the desired sector of 
//disk to rotate into a position so that it can access the read/write heads. So the disk 
//scheduling algorithm that gives minimum rotational latency is better.

//Transfer Time: Transfer time is the time to transfer the data. It depends on the rotating 
//speed of the disk and number of bytes to be transferred.
